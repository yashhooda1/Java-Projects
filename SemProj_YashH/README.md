# Flight Plan

This project creates a flight plan between Houston, Dallas, Austin, and Chicago. 
The flight plan will calculate the cost and distance between the cities and create a flight path
based on the cost or time whichever one you choose. The project will use the LinkedList class which will contain
all the cities and their possible destinations using this class. Each city will have its own linked list. 
The stack class will use the iterative backtracking algorithm to implement an exhautive
search of all the possible flights.  

Output:
 ./flightPlan<FlightDataFile> <PathsToCalculateFile> <OutputFile>
